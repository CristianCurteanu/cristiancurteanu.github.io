Recently I've read an [article](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/softwareideas-io/11k-mrr-and-600-customers--MOaFR5Kk0cQ_EU-I504?utm_campaign=top-milestones-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_source=indie-hackers-emails) on IndieHackers, about a web service called [SoftwareIdeas.io](https://www.softwareideas.io/). It's a service that might seem to solve a problem, but in my opinion is selling air, and I would try to elaborate on that.

It is said that they deliver:

> â€‹	Hand-picked, validated SaaS ideas delivered straight to your inbox

That sound fabulous. But here is the thing: who on earth having such an amazing resource, would share with all other people for just \$57 / 3 months subscription? If I would have such an endless resource, I would rather build software products all day long, and raise tons of money by myself, not only \$11K MRR. 

Just think about it, if you would have 11 products set up, that will make you \$1K profit per month, you would already have the same MRR, instead of sharing it with the whole world. The guy is a programmer, as far as I understand, it would take not that much to build such simple products. Weird right?

By the way, in one of the [blog posts](https://www.softwareideas.io/blog/how-opportunity-sizing-works), the author mentions that in the newsletter will be presented ideas for different sizes of business, and you could expect MRR above \$20K. So he's such a lazy ass, that instead of building those products, he will share it with entire world for such a small fee (small fee in this case is a catch).

Across the entire website, I do not see the word **problem**, only *idea* instead.

> There is no free lunch.

There are a lot of challenges in growing an online business. The product-market fit can be only achieved after an explicit problem definition, and for that you need to talk to your potential customers, and feel their pain. A successfull software product relieves customers' pain, and there is no other way to achieve it rather that to feel that pain by yourself. Otherwise, a product based on analytics has a poor rate for success (I'm not saying someone will not make it the way to solve some people's pain), and that idea is worth nothing.

I can see now how software engineers, aka. indie hackers will spent 57 bucks, to buy this newsletter, and feel themselves as next Steve Jobs, or Bill Gates. But here is a question: do you believe that newsletter will be fully customised? Are you 100% sure that other indie hacker did not received same idea as you did? That means they will target same market, and depending on implementation, most probably on of them will reach 90% of that market. The other one, will have an MRR equal to 10% * [20.000 ... 50.000] => [200 ... 500]. This kind of scale, and risk, is simply not worth it.
